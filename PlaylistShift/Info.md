## More background information about PlaylistShift (in Alpha):
___

 + I wanted to create an application that would use ASP.NET and Google API's to gain 
 experience in working with C# web-tools.
 + My mind mediately jump to Chrome extensions
 + And after all my research I learned of 'Blazor' and knew I needed to use this to make
 my extensions website. Even if it meant making so kind of Frankensteins monster of a project :)
 + So my goal now is to make an extension using Blazor and Google's Youtube Data API v3
